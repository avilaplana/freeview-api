<h3>The purpose of the API</h3>

<p>The reason why I decided to start this open source project is because I wanted to develop a mobile application to show me the content of the tv and provide rate of that. I am aware that all the modern smart tvs provide really cool user interface showing all the the tv guide. But I personally struggle to find the right content and fitted to my taste. I really missed a good search based on genres, series, programs and very important, a really relaible rate indicating the level of that tv program.</p>
